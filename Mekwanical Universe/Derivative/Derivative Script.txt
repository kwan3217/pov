1) Slope
*Demonstrate slope: Steep and shallow straight line
*Calculate slope: Rise over run
*Demonstrate grade (slope in percent) and roof pitch (rise per 12 inch run)
"Here is a straight line in two-dimensional space. How can we tell how steep it is?"
"One way is to measure the angle with a protractor."
"A line which is perfectly horizontal has an angle of 0&deg;"
"One which goes up as you go right has a positive angle..."
"...and one which goes down as you go right has a negative angle"
"We can go all the way to vertical at 90&deg;..."
"...but the line is the same as the one at -90&deg;"
"Any line has an angle between -90 and +90."
"While this will work, there is a way to measure its steepness"
"with only a ruler. This can be a lot more convenient for some purposes."
"We measure a certain distance from the line directly to the right. This is the ''run''."
"We then measure straight up or down. This is the ''rise''."
"Now we divide rise by run and call this the ''slope.''"
"Since the line is straight, it doesn't matter where we do this, the slope is the same everywhere."
"You can choose any run you want, but once you do, the steepness of the line determines the rise and the slope."
"The problem with slope is that no matter how high the slope number is..."
"...we can't reach vertical, since there is a horizontal run."

2) Applications of Slope
"You may have seen a highway sign marked "5% grade". This means that the rise is 5% of the run."
"It doesn't look very steep here, but it does when you are in a big truck burning your brakes."
*Switchback
"The ''pitch'' of a roof is how steep it is. It is customarily measured in rise per 12 inches"
*Slope is Speed

3) Slope on a curve
*Use a parabola
*Secant and tangent line - derivative at one point

4) Formula for derivative
*Left side, curve with secant line marked
*Right side, formula with numbers
*Show DeltaX shrink to dx and see what happens

5) Derivative is an operator
*This operator takes a function and returns a new function
*Show a function and its derivative up-and-down

6) Higher derivatives - Position, velocity, acceleration

7) Derivative rules and numerical derivative

8) Antiderivative

Calculate clocks
*POV-ray clock is normalized
*Time is always available in seconds, frames, normalized
*Time is available from three epochs, beginning of video, scene, shot
*Nine clocks available
*All clocks are global variables
*Video and scene clocks calculated in main loop
*Shot clocks are calculated in scene
