1) Random Variables
*Show a discrete random variable (dice) and a continuous one (spinner)
*Gaussian 1D distribution - bell curve
*Show a vector random variable (dart board)
*Gaussian nD distribution - probability ellipsoid

2) State Vector
*Example - Spring-mass combination
"This is a bobbing mass on a rubber band. It has been pulled from its equilibrium state and then allowed to bounce freely up and down.
Here we have one of the more studied and simple systems in Physics - the simple harmonic oscillator. Since we are in physics land, we
can talk about point masses, ideal springs, frictionless conditions, and so on. We shall invoke all of these at this point so that
we can concentrate on the problem at hand. This system will continue to oscillate forever, at the same amplitude, until disturbed."
"We can produce a graph of its motion versus time, as shown here. The vertical axis represents space, to be specific the displacement
of the bob from its equilibrium point. The horizontal axis represents time. We see that the motion generates a smooth sine wave."
"Here is another system, which is bouncing farther than the first."
"And here is it's graph"
"Let's freeze them at a particular moment in time"

*Matrix Transformation
*State Transition Matrix
*Effect on state
*Effect on probability ellipsoid
*Process noise

3) Estimation

4) Time update
*Show the estimate with the covariance ellipsoid around it
*Transform the estimate
*Move the ellipsoid to the origin, transform it, add process noise, then move it back

5) Measurement update
*Measurement space - perhaps different dimension from state space
*Measurement matrix - transforms a state into a measurement
*Linear filter - Gain matrix
*Measurement innovation
