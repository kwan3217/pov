00:00.000 Distant view of Saturn System, High time rate. Decellerate time rate and zoom exponentially to 
00:07.372 Cassini maneuvers to drop attitude , stabilizes, and 
00:15.419 Huygens released, Cassini maneuvers, rotate around departing pair from behind cassini (looking towards titan) to 
00:25.436 behind huygens, fade to orbit plot superimposed over high speed animation of Huygens falling towards titan
00:41 Titan fills screen now, fade out orbit superimposition, rotate until horizon is just visible at top of screen
00:44.085 Entry interface, side view of Huygens with growing flame trail, shaking, rotate to front view
01:00.081 distant view of huygens, flame trail shrinks, grows more transparent and less orange, sky grows blue
01:12.077 pop drogue parachute
01:14.076 pop main parachute
01:16 drop heat shield, rotate to view from 3/4 above showing cloud layer below
01:24.104 slows down alot, parachute stops shaking, enters cloud layer
01:36.099 lightning flash close
01:44.149 lightning flash, more distant
01:52.162 breaks out of clouds, orange sky, floating straignt down, slowly rotate around spacecraft to show mountains and oceans in distance.
02:22.163 lands softly in lake, 100 yards away from beach
02:25.843 parachute floats to surface, slowly rotate around spacecraft and 
02:39 fade into view from camera, seasick horizon, across methane lake to distant mountain peaks
02:40.073 back up through back wall of camera into instrument compartment and pan over to antenna
02:48.109 zoom out of spacecraft looking back at antenna, through a hole in the clouds, exponentially gaining speed until...
03:04.174 reach cassini spacecraft, pan around and look back towards the sun (and earth)
03:10 start slow fade to black
03:13 finish
