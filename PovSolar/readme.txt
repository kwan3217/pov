This archive includes the POV source code and some image and bump maps needed to
create accurate 3D models of many of the solar system bodies, including the Sun,
all of the Planets, the moon of Earth, and the Galilean moons of Jupiter. It also
includes a test mode "family portrait" POV file.

Some images are not included, specifically those from Bjorn Jonsson's and
Constantine Thomas' site.  They have asked that no one should repost maps from
their sites. In the unlikely event that these or any other source of maps goes
down permanently, I keep all of the image maps for myself. Email me if you
cannot get a map any other way, and I can send it to you.

I used to say that I don't create data, I just collect it. Now I collect and
format it. What follows is the creation history of each file as best as I can
track it.

Sun:
POV Source code by me, using radius data from Horizons (ssd.jpl.nasa.gov).

Earth:
POV Source originally from Constantine Thomas
   http://www.btinternet.com/~consty/render/planets/earth.htm
   Modified heavily by me. Replaced all of the image maps and the land/sea
   differentiation code. Also added the night lights sphere code. Thomas has
   since modified the model also, so the model has forked.

Cloud Map from Constantine Thomas
   http://www.btinternet.com/~consty/render/planets/earth.htm
   He has since redone his cloud map to fit his new model.
