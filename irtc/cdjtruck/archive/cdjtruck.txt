ANIMATION DESCRIPTION: 

  This is dedicated to my teacher, Mr Peddicord, and all my classmates
in CIS420, Southern Oregon University.
  Mr. Peddicord came back from a week's trip to Arizona, and told us all
about it. He told us about a strip mine he went to, where they use some
of the World's Biggest Dump Trucks to haul the ore. Then he told us all
to render a picture of a dump truck in POV.
  One day in computer imaging class, I walk into class and Mr. Peddicord
says, "Everyone take out a piece of paper and draw a neutron star being 
sucked into a black hole." Then he told us to render a dump truck in C++.
  I was getting sick and tired of dump trucks, so I decided to put together
the two ideas, and my own destructive attitude when it comes to toys. I 
remember I had an old yellow Zonka(tm) truck I used to play with in the 
sand pile. The most fun thing to do was to push it really fast and roll it
over a hill onto its side. Or drop it from the top of the slide and watch
it bounce. A lot of things that could never happen with a real dump truck.
  So, trucks in space. My toy dump truck boldly going where no dumptruck has
gone before. And probably never will. I think in the entire history of the
universe, this has never happened and never will.


VIEWING RECOMMENDATIONS: 

  Any old MPEG player should work, preferrably run it at 10-15 fps


DESCRIPTION OF HOW THIS ANIMATION WAS CREATED: 

  Everything you see is CSG. Mo modeller was used.I modelled the 
truck first, got it how I like. Then I made some backgrounds for the 
truck to tumble through.
  The Red Giant is a halo, the stars and background is from GALAXY.INC
The animation is in four .POV files, one each for each scene. The truck
is in it's own .INC file. There is nothing too technically spectacular here.

No dump trucks were harmed in the making of this movie.
