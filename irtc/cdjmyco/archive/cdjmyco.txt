IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
This is a MYCORUM. Doesn't look like much, does it. It's just a simple 
little atomic scale machine, whose sole reason for existence is to 
build more copies of itself. By itself it's not much, but
its strength is it can make copies of itself from whatever is around it.
It really likes organic materials, such as wood, plastic, plants, people,
and it can adapt to whatever environment it is in. Some mycorum have 
evolved to use silicon in stone and glass, some like metals, some like
water, some like air, and so on. They all like heat. If nothing stops them, 
they might take over the world.

This is from Bloom, by Wil McCarthy. Check out the first chapter at:
